# DCGM does not have a stable API interface for Alpha and Beta deliveries
# This causes CSM to require coreq changes when a new version of DCGM becomes available
# In order to stage these changes into git, use REQUIRED_DCGM_VERSION to control compilation
#
# Process when new DCGM becomes available:
# Set REQUIRED_DCGM_VERSION to new version in git to disable compilation everywhere
# Test new version of DCGM with CSM in sandbox and commit changes when ready
# Upgrade level of DCGM everywhere to enable the changes to resume compilation
