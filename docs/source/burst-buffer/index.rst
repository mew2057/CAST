Burst Buffer
============

A cost-effective mechanism that can improve I/O performance for a large class of high-performance 
computing applications without requirement of intermediary hardware. Burst Buffer provides:

 * A fast storage tier between compute nodes and the traditional parallel file system
 * Overlapping job stage-in and stage-out of data for checkpoint and restart
 * Scratch volumes
 * Extended memory I/O workloads
