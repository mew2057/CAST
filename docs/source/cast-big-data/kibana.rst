Kibana
======

`Kibana`_ is an open-sourced data visualization tool used in the EL\ **K** stack.

CAST provides a utility plugin for multistep searches of CSM jobs in Kibana dashboards.

Configuration
-------------

.. note:: This guide has been tested using Kibana 6.3.2, the latest RPM may be downloaded from
    `the Elastic Site <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana>`_.

The following is a brief introduction to the installation and configuration of the Kibana service.

At the current time CAST does not provide a configuration file in its RPM.

1. Install the Kibana rpm:

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install -y kibana-*.rpm

2. Configure the Kibana YAML file (`/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`)

CAST recommends the following four values be set before starting Kibana:

+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Setting                | Description                                                 | Sample Value            |

+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
